 * `ModelDocumentSelection` is a special selection which is used as the
 * {@link module:engine/model/document~ModelDocument#selection document's selection}.
 * There can be only one instance of `ModelDocumentSelection` per document.
 *
 * Document selection can only be changed by using the {@link module:engine/model/writer~ModelWriter} instance
 * inside the {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#change `change()`} block, as it provides a secure way to modify model.
 *
 * `ModelDocumentSelection` is automatically updated upon changes in the {@link module:engine/model/document~ModelDocument document}
 * to always contain valid ranges. Its attributes are inherited from the text unless set explicitly.
 *
 * Differences between {@link module:engine/model/selection~ModelSelection} and `ModelDocumentSelection` are:
 * * there is always a range in `ModelDocumentSelection` - even if no ranges were added there is a "default range"
 * present in the selection,
 * * ranges added to this selection updates automatically when the document changes,
 * * attributes of `ModelDocumentSelection` are updated automatically according to selection ranges.
 *
 * Since `ModelDocumentSelection` uses {@link module:engine/model/liverange~ModelLiveRange live ranges}
 * and is updated when {@link module:engine/model/document~ModelDocument document}
 * changes, it cannot be set on {@link module:engine/model/node~ModelNode nodes}
 * that are inside {@link module:engine/model/documentfragment~ModelDocumentFragment document fragment}.
 * If you need to represent a selection in document fragment,
 * use {@link module:engine/model/selection~ModelSelection Selection class} instead.
