## What is this?

This is like [`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify] but for browsers.
This plugin uses DOM APIs to do its work, which makes it smaller in browsers, at
the cost of not supporting formatting options.

## When should I use this?

Use this package when you want to use `rehype-stringify` solely in browsers.
See [the monorepo readme][rehype-dom] for info on when to use `rehype-dom`.

This plugin is built on [`hast-util-to-dom`][hast-util-to-dom], which is a low
level tool to turn hast syntax trees into DOM nodes.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-dom-stringify
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeDomStringify from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom-stringify@4'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeDomStringify from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom-stringify@4?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our page `example.html` contains:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Example</title>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import remarkParse from 'https://esm.sh/remark-parse@11?bundle'
  import remarkRehype from 'https://esm.sh/remark-rehype@11?bundle'
  import rehypeDomStringify from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-dom-stringify@4?bundle'
  import {unified} from 'https://esm.sh/unified@11?bundle'

  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypeDomStringify)
    .process('# Hello, world!')

  console.log(String(file))
</script>
```

â€¦opening it in a browser prints the following to the browser console:

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeDomStringify`][api-rehype-dom-stringify].

### `unified().use(rehypeDomStringify[, options])`

Add support for serializing as HTML with DOM APIs.

###### Parameters

* `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
  â€” configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the default of the `fragment` option is `true` in this package,
> which is different from the value in `rehype-parse`, as this makes more sense
> in browsers.

###### Fields

* `fragment` (`boolean`, default: `true`)
  â€” specify whether to serialize a fragment
* `namespace` (`string`, optional)
  â€” namespace to start with

## Syntax

HTML is parsed and serialized according to what a browser supports (which
*should* be WHATWG HTML).

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree used in rehype is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

It also registers `Settings` with `unified`.
If youâ€™re passing options with `.data('settings', â€¦)`, make sure to import this
package somewhere in your types, as that registers the fields.

```js
/**
 * @import {} from 'rehype-dom-stringify'
 */

import {unified} from 'unified'

// @ts-expect-error: `thisDoesNotExist` is not a valid option.
unified().data('settings', {thisDoesNotExist: false})
```

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`rehype-dom-stringify@^4`, compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom-stringify` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting
(XSS)][xss] attack if dangerous content is used and the result is used with
the actual DOM.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to solve that.
